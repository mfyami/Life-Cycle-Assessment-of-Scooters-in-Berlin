# 🌍 Life Cycle Assessment of Scooters in Berlin

This project evaluates the environmental impacts of three types of scooters — **Electric**, **Two-Stroke**, and **Four-Stroke** — across their entire life cycle, using the LCA methodology.

## 🎯 Goal
To compare the full life cycle impacts (cradle to grave) of different scooter types in Berlin and identify environmental hotspots to support greener mobility decisions.

## 📍 Scope
- **Region:** Berlin, Germany
- **Life cycle stages:** Production, Transportation, Use Phase, End-of-Life
- **Methodology:** Life Cycle Assessment using **openLCA** and the **ecoinvent 3.6** database

## 📊 Functional Unit
- 1 Person-Kilometer (p*km)
- Total: 55,000 p*km (based on 50,000 km × 1.1 passengers)

## 🧪 LCIA Method
- **ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H)** methodology
- Indicators analyzed: Global Warming, Fossil Resource Scarcity, Human Toxicity, Particulate Matter, etc.

## ⚙️ Key Assumptions
- Equal lifespan of 50,000 km for all scooters
- Manual dismantling assumed for all models
- Electric scooter battery produced in China
- Emissions modeled using adjusted literature values

## 🛠️ Life Cycle Inventory
- Two scenarios for electric scooter batteries
- Varied transportation routes (Asia/Italy to Berlin)
- Three electricity mixes analyzed (Average, Green, Airport)
- Use-phase data highlights dominance of emissions from combustion scooters

## 📈 Summary of Results
- **Two-Stroke:** Highest emissions (CO, VOCs, particulates)
- **Four-Stroke:** Better, but still high NOx
- **Electric Scooter:** Best if powered by renewable energy; worst if powered by fossil fuels

## ✅ Conclusions & Recommendations
- Promote **green energy adoption** for electric vehicles
- Phase out two-stroke scooters gradually
- Encourage **eco-design and recyclable materials**
- Need for better LCA data in the future
